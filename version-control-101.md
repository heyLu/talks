version control 101

(how to never lose your work again)
objective: show using a vcs using real-world problems

* 10 minutes
* demonstrate common workflow (add, commit, reset, mv/rm, branch/checkout, push)
* motivate vcs use w/ real problems, ideally on a simple example

possible examples:

* write a presentation (such as this one)
* write a blog
* write a simple program (using an existing one?)
* use [Try Git](http://try.github.io)

# have you ever ...?

* written/programmed something awesome and then lost it?
    - if not, you will soon
    - could be hard drive failure/theft, accidentally deleted
* wanted to try out a new idea without losing existing work?
    - duplicating a file, changing it and then manually comparing them sucks
* wanted to work on some idea with someone else concurrently?
    - dropbox & co are made for sharing, not working together

# well, a VCS is there to help

* VCS = version control system
* `git` is a DVCS (distributed VCS)
* starting out is easy
* you benefit now (never lose work, try out new ideas, collaborate)
* and can learn more as you go (worked for me, plenty of tutorials/people
    to help you)
