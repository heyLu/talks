version control 101

(how to never lose your work again)
objective: show using a vcs using real-world problems

* 10 minutes
* demonstrate common workflow (add, commit, reset, mv/rm, branch/checkout, push)
* motivate vcs use w/ real problems, ideally on a simple example

possible examples:

* write a presentation (such as this one)
* write a blog
* write a simple program (using an existing one?)
* use [Try Git](http://try.github.io)

# problems

* losing work
    - hard disk broken/lost/stolen
    - accidentally deleted `~me/my-awesome-projects`
* trying out different ideas is difficult
    - especially when reusing some parts, but changing others
