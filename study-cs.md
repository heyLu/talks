should you study CS? probably.

objective: encourage people to study CS, but w/ give perspective & note obstacles
    ideally, present n (small) points that are important

best-of, problems, requirements, personal assessment

reasons to study:
- create (awesome things), you can work w/ 3 months training (or similar, no university required)
- learn  (also awesome things), this is what you should learn

most important points:
- you'll learn to think (structured & methodically, general skill)
- fight procrastination
- it's a lot of work (w/o any previous experience, but still)
- push yourself (read about new/unfamilar things, try many things, mentor, goals)
- do side projects (good for work later, share them, record progress, reflect)

myths
- cs is scary
- math is hard
- you must have some talent

* just doing what you have to works, but it will just make you a mediocre programmer
* get comfortable reading/writing english (e.g. be able to keep up-to-date yourself)
    - what helped me: reading/struggling through blogs, books and movies
        (and 6 weeks only talking english at home, but thinking in english helps, too)

* problem solving can't be taught, you learn it by trying to solve
    problems and watching yourself (and mentoring)

# resources

* some blogs (?)
* talent is overrated (it's hard work, not talent or pure intelligence)
* apprenticeship patterns (find a mentor, reflect on what you do)
* \_why's poignant guide to ruby, learn you a haskell
* thinking mathematically, drawing on the right side of the brain
* you are not so smart (especially "procrastination")
