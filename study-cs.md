should you study CS? probably.

objective: encourage people to study CS, but w/ give perspective & note obstacles
    ideally, present n (small) points that are important

* cs isn't as scary as you might think
* there are a lot of people out there, find them (for example, here?)
* yes, you can do very well without cs
* but if you do it right, you'll learn how to solve difficult problems (analytical thinking, life skill)
    - different phrasing: cs is learning to think
* math knowledge helps, but you don't need to be a wizard
* it's a lot of work (especially without any prior knowledge)
* share what you're doing on the side (feedback, collaboration, motivation)
* push yourself always a bit beyond what you know
* record progress
* set small goal, achieve it, again (e.g. after today, write a smallish rails app)
    - it will take days & weeks, especially if you're doing it all alone,
        but you will learn *a lot*
* there's always more to learn (cs will get you started)
* read (a lot, sometimes books, but also blogs and at least some papers)
* have side projects
* just doing what you have to works, but it will just make you a mediocre programmer
* get comfortable reading/writing english (e.g. be able to keep up-to-date yourself)
    - what helped me: reading/struggling through blogs, books and movies
        (and 6 weeks only talking english at home, but thinking in english helps, too)

* problem solving can't be taught, you learn it by trying to solve
    problems and watching yourself (and mentoring)

# my mistakes

# resources

* some blogs (?)
* talent is overrated (it's hard work, not talent or pure intelligence)
* apprenticeship patterns (find a mentor, reflect on what you do)
* \_why's poignant guide to ruby, learn you a haskell
